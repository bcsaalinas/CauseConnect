**Next Steps**

\-Make the NGO Directory Filters Actually Work

**Personal Reflection**

Made the SDGS section more readable and alive, sort of looked boring before

**Alberto:**  
I was looking for cool frameworks to learn for front end, and came across with GSAP,[GSAP Docs](https://gsap.com/resources), I will redesign the front end to practice and learn this framework  
**First redesign step:**  
 \- changes: introduced new design tokens and utility classes to the main stylesheet; no markup touched yet.  
 \- why: we need shared foundations before reshaping each page’s layout—these tokens/utilities let us apply glass surfaces, spacing, and animations with minimal edits.  
 \- challenges: balancing richer effects with beginner-friendly css; solved by keeping class names literal and grouping transitions in one place.  
 \- lessons: a small set of purposeful utilities gives us the premium look without complicating the existing bootstrap markup.

**Second redesign step**  
changes: rebuilt the homepage layout, enhanced header/footer shells, and introduced shared glass/animation utilities in main.css.  
 \- why: establish the premium aesthetic while keeping the existing palette, typography, and section order.  
 \- challenges: keeping the markup beginner-friendly while layering glass effects—solved by creating reusable classes such as glass-panel, fade-up, and hero-wave.  
 \- lessons: front-loading utility work made it easy to slot in new sections without touching backend logic; the fade-up classes will tie directly into the planned GSAP scroll tweens later.

Errors: Tried to change the text to white and update background, but text on the navbar was barely visible, brought it back to black so it can be readen better

**Documents used:**  
GSAP Documentation

**Third redesign step:**  
 \- changes: rebuilt contact markup into hero \+ two-column form/details layout, replaced old card imagery, and refreshed CSS for form control states and social buttons.  
 \- why: give the form a premium feel with inline error messaging and keep the structure ready for future backend validation and GSAP animations.  
 \- challenges: balancing the richer layout with simple markup—solved by reusing glass-panel, fade-up, and straightforward grid classes.  
 \- lessons: keeping validation messaging in place (but hidden) now means the front-end and back-end will integrate more smoothly later.  
 Next tasks: build the reactive JS layer (including GSAP timelines) and capture notes on any complex pieces before the final QA pass.

\- Refined the home experience with split hero, highlight cards, stats, testimonials, and CTA sections using the new glass utilities.  
 \- Reworked directory filters into a floating glass panel with live result chips and responsive cards, plus polished empty state.  
 \- Restyled the SDG page into hero, tile grid, and video bands while keeping the original copy, ready for scroll animations.  
 \- Modernized the contact page with a two-column layout, inline validation hooks, and glass social buttons .  
 \- Upgraded the global shell: translucent sticky navbar, skip link, footer glass shell, and CDN-loaded GSAP with custom scripts.  
 Animation & JS Layer  
 \- Added navigation scroll state handling, friendly form validators, and GSAP-driven fade/scroll effects with an IntersectionObserver fallback for no-network scenarios .  
 \- Registered fade-up utilities with reduced-motion and no-JS safeguards so the layout degrades gracefully .  
 \- Documented how to tweak animations and tokens directly in the repo (README.md:25).  
 Dev Log  
 \- changes: built glassmorphism layouts across home, directory, sdg, and contact pages; wired navbar/footer polish; added gsap \+ fallback scripts; refreshed documentation.  
 \- why: deliver the Apple-like, animated front end while staying friendly for future backend integration.  
 \- challenges: network sandbox blocked npm installs, so gsap loads via CDN and scripts detect availability before animating.  
 \- lessons: centralizing utility classes keeps markup simple; providing no-js and reduced-motion fallbacks ensures accessibility even with the new animations.  
 Next Steps  
 \- Run a full responsive \+ accessibility sweep (keyboard focus, contrast, reduced motion).  
 \- Verify GSAP loads from the CDN in deployment; consider self-hosting if the host requires it. \- Integrate backend responses for contact form errors/success using the placeholders already in place.  
**Fourth redesign step:**  
\- changes: rewired server/view paths, refreshed routing, added the animation scripts, and polished page templates to match the new structure.  
 \- why: needed the Express stack to serve the updated EJS templates and enable the GSAP-powered animations we just added.  
 \- challenges: npm install worked, but running npm start inside this sandbox fails with EPERM on port 3000; verified the code path until the bind step and left GSAP with a graceful fallback.  
 \- lessons: keeping all utility classes and CDN hooks centralized made it easy to pivot—the hero animation and scroll fades only needed a tiny timeline once the structure was consistent.

**Fifth redesign step:**  
\- changes: routed GSAP via npm, orchestrated a cinematic hero entrance with tidy comments, and tuned hero spacing for medium breakpoints.  
 \- why: showcase a premium, first impression using maintainable animation code tied to the local package.  
 \- challenges: ensuring the animation stays accessible; fallbacks remain in place via reduced-motion checks.  
 \- lessons: centralizing the timeline in one script keeps complex effects easy to adjust; serving GSAP locally prevents future CDN drift.  
Scroll Storytelling Upgrade  
 \- Highlights cards now sweep in with a tilt and quick stagger thanks to a ScrollTrigger timeline, giving the section a curated reveal.  
 \- Stats each glass panel floats up, while the numbers count to their targets with prefix/suffix preserved .  
 \- Testimonials cards drift in from alternating sides, adding depth as you scroll.  
 \- CTA band scales up on entry and gently pulses via an infinite yoyo shadow for a premium finish.  
 \- All animations respect reduced-motion and fall back to IntersectionObserver if GSAP isn't present, with plain-language comments explaining each block.

**Final Redesign Step: Polishing the GSAP Animations**

**Use of Gen AI:** Heavy usage. This was my first time using GSAP for real animations, so I spent a lot of time with the GSAP documentation and asking AI questions like "how do I make cards stagger on scroll?" and "what's the difference between ScrollTrigger and regular timelines?" 

**What I Actually Did:**
- Read through GSAP docs to understand the basics - timelines, tweens, and the ScrollTrigger plugin
- Started with simple fade-ups on the homepage and gradually added more complex stuff
- Used AI to help debug timing issues - like when cards would appear too fast or overlap weirdly
- Asked AI to explain `data-animate` attributes and how to connect them to GSAP
- Learned about `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility - AI helped me understand why this matters
- Created the `gsap-animations.js` file with different animation types (fade, stagger, counter, etc.)
- Added fallbacks using IntersectionObserver for when GSAP doesn't load

**Challenges I Faced:**
❌ Animations running before content loaded - everything was invisible!
✅ Fixed by adding proper initialization checks and waiting for DOM ready

❌ Scroll animations triggering too early or too late on different screen sizes
✅ Solution: Learned about ScrollTrigger start/end values and tested on different devices

❌ Understanding the timeline syntax - so many options!
✅ AI helped break it down into simple examples, then I built from there

❌ Performance issues with too many animations running at once
✅ Learned to use `will-change` CSS property and batch animations together

**What I Learned:**
- GSAP is super powerful but has a learning curve - documentation is your friend
- Animation timing is more art than science - had to tweak values a lot
- Accessibility matters - not everyone wants animations (reduced-motion)
- The `data-animate` pattern keeps HTML clean and JS organized
- ScrollTrigger needs proper cleanup or animations break on navigation
- Counter animations are surprisingly tricky to get smooth

**Resources Used:**
- GSAP Documentation (https://gsap.com/docs)
- GSAP ScrollTrigger docs specifically
- CodePen examples from GSAP community
- AI (GitHub Copilot) for debugging specific issues
- YouTube tutorials for understanding timelines

**Personal Reflection:**
"GSAP ended up being way cooler than I expected! At first it felt overwhelming with all the options, but once I understood timelines and ScrollTrigger, everything clicked. The best part was seeing the cards actually animate on scroll - made the site feel professional. I definitely relied on AI to understand the concepts faster, but I made sure to test everything myself and understand WHY it worked, not just copy-paste. Proud of how the animations turned out, even though it took longer than I thought!"

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/public/js/gsap-animations.js` - Main animation controller
- `src/public/css/main.css` - Added animation utility classes
- All EJS templates - Added `data-animate` attributes
- `src/views/layouts/header.ejs` - GSAP script loading

**Date:** 21 Oct 2025  
**Project / Module:** Mexican NGO Directory Implementation

**Goals for the session:**

- Replace broken GlobalGiving API with working data source
- Populate directory with real Mexican NGOs
- Make search and filter features actually work
- Remove sections that don't work (Featured Initiatives, broken filters)

**Tasks Completed:**

- Created new API endpoint at `/api/mexican-ngos` with 20 verified Mexican organizations
- Added real NGO data - researched and included orgs like Cruz Roja, BAMX, Techo México, etc.
- Updated the directory route to fetch from our new API instead of static files
- Made cause and city filters dynamic - they now populate from the actual data
- Redesigned NGO cards to show more info (location, year founded, contact details)
- Fixed search bar to work with both organization names and their missions
- Added proper error handling so if something breaks, users see a friendly message

**Use of Gen AI:**

**Heavy usage:** This was our first time building a custom API, so I used AI a lot. Asked it to explain how REST APIs work, how to structure the data, and how Express routes connect to EJS templates. Used AI to debug the "error is not defined" issue in EJS - learned you need to pass ALL variables to the template even if they're null.

**Research usage:** Read Express documentation to understand middleware and routing. Looked at Node.js fetch API docs since we're making internal API calls. Asked AI to help research Mexican NGOs to make sure we had real, verified organizations.

**What I Learned:**

- How to build a REST API from scratch with Express
- The difference between static data and API-fetched data
- How async/await works - had to change the route from regular function to async
- EJS templates need every variable defined or they crash
- How to use fetch() in Node.js (it's built-in now!)
- Dynamic dropdowns - using EJS loops to populate select options from API data
- Better error handling - try/catch blocks and fallback UI

**Challenges & Bugs:**

❌ GlobalGiving Atlas API wasn't working - kept getting errors
✅ Solution: Built our own API with curated data. Better control anyway!

❌ Port 3000 already in use when testing
✅ Solution: Asked AI how to kill the process, learned `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`

❌ Page crashed with "error is not defined"
✅ Solution: Had to add `error: null` to the successful render. Every EJS variable needs to be passed!

❌ Filters weren't showing any options
✅ Solution: API now returns `filterOptions` object with unique causes and cities

❌ Search only worked for names, not missions
✅ Solution: Changed filter logic to check BOTH name and mission with OR operator

**Resources Used:**

- Express.js documentation for routing and middleware
- EJS documentation for template syntax
- Node.js fetch API docs
- AI (ChatGPT/Copilot) for debugging and explaining concepts
- MDN for JavaScript array methods (filter, map, forEach)

**Next Steps:**

- Add more Mexican NGOs to the database (goal: 50-100)
- Maybe add pagination if we get too many results
- Consider adding SDG tags to each NGO
- Create individual pages for each organization with more details
- Add "favorite" feature so users can save NGOs they like
- Look into connecting to real Mexican NGO registry APIs if they exist

**Personal Reflection:**

"This was challenging but really rewarding! Building an API seemed scary at first, but breaking it down into steps made it manageable. I learned that sometimes building your own solution is better than fighting with a broken external API. The key was asking AI the right questions and then actually understanding the code it suggested instead of just copy-pasting. Still a beginner but feeling more confident with backend stuff now!"

**Files Changed:**

- Created: `src/routes/api/mexican-ngos.js` (new API)
- Modified: `server.js` (added new route)
- Modified: `src/routes/ngoRoutes.js` (switched to API calls)
- Modified: `src/views/pages/directory.ejs` (better filters and cards)
